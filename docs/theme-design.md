# Theme Design: Seed, Derivation, and the Preference/Theory Boundary

Status: initial design, decided in-session with the owner on 2026-07-15.
Several defaults are explicitly provisional and expected to be tuned through
dogfooding; they are marked as such below. This document is the
self-contained record of the decisions; `docs/roadmap.md` should only index
it. Slice B1 (the seed schema + headless OKLCH derivation core — `src/theme.rs`'s
`scheme_from`, `src/theme/oklab.rs`) landed 2026-07-15, settling the five
"Provisional details" below. Slice B2 (the UI-snap seam wiring) landed
2026-07-15: `gpui_component_theme_config` now projects the scheme's six
resolved hues onto gpui-component's `base.*`/`chart.*` fields (faithful,
unsnapped -- every consumer found in the vendored source paints them as
fills/marks, not text), and a new `readable_on(color, surface) -> Hsla`
(`src/theme.rs`) generalizes the pre-existing `contrast_safe_default`
(background-only) to an arbitrary surface via
`oklab::solve_lightness_for_ratio`. `readable_on` is wired into
`src/agent/view.rs` at the two spots where role text sits on
`surface_panel` (the expandable receipt row's header, snapped only while
actually expanded, and the follow-pill's labels); every other
`danger()`/`success()`/`warning()`/`info()`/`text_muted()` call site in
that file paints on the plain background and stays untouched, still
covered by B1's own background-only snapping. `diff_added_text`/
`diff_removed_text`'s *default* (unset-key case only, `scheme_from`) now
snaps against their own `diff_added_surface`/`diff_removed_surface`
rather than the raw semantic color, for the same reason. Left explicitly
faithful (unsnapped), per the seam's own "prefer the faithful hue" rule
for ambiguous fields: the `base.*`/`chart.*` fill projection above, and
every `.alpha()`-tinted fill/border call site in `src/agent/view.rs`
(`text_subtle().alpha(...)`, `warning().alpha(...)`, etc.) -- the seam
only ever applies to *text*. `text_subtle()` itself is never snapped
anywhere (decorative by definition, exempt from the text floor).
`readable_on` is call-time (not precomputed into `Scheme`), used only from
`src/agent/view.rs` render methods -- never from any per-cell terminal
painting path, so `scheme()`'s own hot-path cost is unchanged.

The command-palette/view-chooser/session-manager modal surfaces and the
"Related, independent fixes" hardcoded-color bugs below landed 2026-07-15
too. The owner compared four mockup variants for the modal surface and
chose **design "C"**: the modal reads as background-colored itself
(`theme::background()`), separated from the dimmed workspace behind it by
the existing 1px `theme::border()` plus a real two-layer drop shadow
(`src/theme.rs`'s `overlay_shadow()`, polarity-aware -- stronger alpha on
dark schemes, where the same shadow washes out against an already-dark
ground) -- not by a darker panel color (`surface_raised`, the previous
look). `gpui_component_theme_config`'s `popover` role (gpui-component's
own context menus/dropdowns) was switched from `surface_raised` to
`background` too, so every floating-chrome surface in the app follows the
same philosophy; `surface_raised` itself is kept (role, config key, and
`theme::surface_raised()` accessor) for other/future consumers, just
unread by anything today. Left explicitly open, for dogfooding: the
workspace-mode dim scrim (`src/workspace.rs`'s `WORKSPACE_MODE_DIM_ALPHA`,
a `background`-colored veil over unfocused panes) was deliberately left
alone by this slice, and its own metaphor wasn't reconsidered against "C"
-- it's a *fade* (a bg-colored veil, whose direction already flips
correctly with polarity since the veil is bg-colored) rather than a
*shadow* (which would darken the dimmed area in both polarities, unlike a
veil). Whether the scrim should eventually switch to the shadow metaphor
too, for visual consistency with the modal surfaces, is an open question
for a later dogfooding pass -- not decided here.

## Problem

`[theme]` today is ~20 flat role keys plus 16 `[theme.ansi]` slots, every
value hand-picked (the owner's real config is 31 hand-tuned lines). Nothing
guarantees readability: measured against the owner's light scheme,
`text_primary` sits at 5.31:1 against the background (a deliberate,
compliant "soft" choice) while `text_muted` sits at 4.2:1 — just below the
4.5:1 WCAG AA floor — which is the quantitative identity of the reported
"secondary text is too faint" problem. Three of the six configured hues
(green/yellow/cyan) are unreadable as text on that background (2.3–2.6:1)
yet nothing stops UI code from using them as text colors.

Goals, as stated by the owner:

- few configuration items, settable interactively from a "readability"
  standpoint;
- existing scheme ecosystems (base16/base24/tinted-theming) reachable —
  resolved below as a deferred *import* feature, not a native format;
- every view converging on the same look, with colorful expression
  (gpui-component) generated from the configured scheme rather than
  invented per-view.

## Design principle: hue is preference, lightness geometry is theory

OKLCH lets lightness (and chroma) be adjusted while preserving perceived
hue. That separation is the load-bearing idea: **the user owns the scheme's
identity, the system owns its legibility.**

User-specified (preference — theory cannot derive these):

- **`background`** — a direct hex value, the anchor of all derivation,
  never derived. A single color carries the owner's actual preference
  ("a gray with restrained lightness") better than any decomposition into
  polarity/dimming/tint knobs would; polarity is *inferred* from its
  lightness instead of being a separate switch.
- **The hue set** — six ANSI-shaped hues (red, green, yellow, blue,
  magenta, cyan). The scheme's identity; not derivable.
- **The accent designation** — which hue leads the UI. A slot reference
  (e.g. `blue`) or a direct hex (provisional; see open details).
- **The contrast character** — one continuous knob: the target contrast
  ratio for primary text, clamped at the 4.5:1 floor. Physically
  meaningful (the owner's current taste measures 5.3), self-documenting,
  and presets can be layered on later as named values.

Derived (theory — done with confidence, validated by measurement):

- **Polarity** from background lightness.
- **`foreground`**, by default: inherits the background's tint, lightness
  set from the contrast knob. Override allowed (schemes that tint their
  foreground, e.g. Solarized). The owner's `#666666` on `#f6f6f6`
  reproduces under this derivation with no override.
- **The neutral ladder** — panel/raised/selected/chrome surfaces and
  borders, stepped from the background toward the foreground in OKLCH
  with guaranteed perceptual separation. Exact step values are
  implementation-tuned: the owner's config is a *plausibility fixture*
  (orderings, floors, "roughly here") — explicitly **not** golden values,
  per the owner ("the steps were set by feel; don't trust them").
- **Text roles** — primary follows the knob; muted derives from it but is
  floored at 4.5:1 (readable, always); subtle is *decorative by
  definition* — exempt from text floors, guaranteed only to separate from
  surfaces. The primary/muted vs. subtle split makes "should be readable
  but isn't" a reviewable property.
- **State variants** — hover/active/selection backgrounds, focus ring,
  on-accent foreground (generalizing the existing
  `primary_foreground_for`).
- **Semantic colors** (danger/warning/success/info) from the hue set, with
  polarity/contrast snapping (generalizing the existing
  `contrast_safe_default`).
- **ANSI black/white and brights** when unset (light polarity inverts
  black/white as the owner's config already does by hand).

## The terminal-faithful / UI-snap seam

The terminal palette is emitted **verbatim** from the user's hue values —
ANSI slot semantics belong to the programs running in the terminal, and
auto-adjusting them is invasive. When the *UI* borrows the same hues (e.g.
success-colored text in the agent pane, colorful accents in
gpui-component views), the borrowed color is **contrast-snapped**: hue
preserved, lightness adjusted to meet the text floor for the surface it
sits on. One hue set, two projections.

## Layering and compatibility

```
seed        background + 6 hues + accent (+ contrast knob)   ~8 lines
  ↓ derivation (this design)
role layer  the existing ~20 [theme] keys — all kept, now an override layer
  ↓ projection (existing)
outputs     terminal 16 colors · ~20 gpui-component fields
            (the remaining ~120 gpui-component fields keep cascading
             through gpui-component's own fallback formulas)
```

Backward compatibility is structural: every existing role key remains
authoritative when set, so the owner's current 31-line config keeps
working unchanged; a seed-only config gets everything derived.

## Deferred / out of scope

- **base16/base24 import** — handled as a *converter* that writes a
  `[theme]` config, not as a natively-loaded runtime format. Keeping the
  hue slots ANSI-shaped costs nothing now and makes the eventual shim the
  mapping already printed in the base16 spec itself (base08→red,
  base0B→green, base0A→yellow, base0D→blue, base0E→magenta, base0C→cyan,
  base00≈bg, base05≈fg). Deliberately postponed by the owner.
- **Interactive tuning UI** — the seed model defines what such a surface
  would edit (background picker, hue pickers, one contrast slider). The
  in-flight `color-picker` worktree branch predates this design (manual
  12-color palette); reconcile at its integration.
- **Syntax-highlighting token tree** (tinted8's `syntax.*` analog) — not
  addressed here.
- gpui-component's `ThemeRegistry`/`watch_dir` theme-JSON machinery
  remains unused; Horizon keeps projecting its own scheme into a synthetic
  `ThemeConfig`.

## Provisional details (settle at implementation or through dogfooding)

The owner approved the decisions above while noting they may be revisited
as operational feel accumulates. In addition, the following were chosen by
default rather than discussed, and are explicitly open:

- **TOML shape of the seed** — **Settled 2026-07-15 (slice B1
  implementation).** The leading candidate was adopted as-is: the six
  `[theme.ansi]` hue slots double as the seed's hue set (no new keys),
  and `surface_base` (the *existing* key — explicitly not a new
  `background` key) is the anchor. `accent` (existing `[theme]` key) was
  extended to accept a slot name (`"red"`/`"green"`/`"yellow"`/`"blue"`/
  `"magenta"`/`"cyan"`) in addition to a hex value; a slot name resolves
  to that `[theme.ansi]` slot's already-resolved value, then every
  downstream accent derivation is identical regardless of spelling (no
  special casing). See `crates/horizon-config/src/lib.rs`'s
  `RawThemeConfig`, `src/theme.rs`'s `SeedHues`/`resolve_accent`.
- **Knob name and default** — **Settled 2026-07-15.** The new `[theme]`
  key is `text_contrast`: a number, clamped to `[4.5, 21.0]`, default
  `15` (the built-in dark scheme's measured fg/bg ratio, 15.01 — chosen
  so the default appearance is unchanged; the owner's own measured 5.3
  was the *reference point* considered, but it's their deliberate override
  on the *light* scheme, not the built-in dark scheme's own ratio the
  zero-config default needs to reproduce). Deserialized leniently
  (`crates/horizon-config`'s `deserialize_lenient_f64`) so an unparsable
  value drops to the default silently, matching `[theme]`'s existing
  per-key policy for hex-string roles, rather than failing the whole
  config file's parse the way a plain typed field would.
- **Brights derivation** — **Settled 2026-07-15, explicitly still
  dogfooding-tunable** (this was the most feel-sensitive call in the
  slice; expect it to move), plus the closely-related `black`/`white`
  rule it builds on. `black`/`white` are role-based, not lightness-picked:
  `black` ← the resolved background, `white` ← the resolved foreground,
  on both polarities — base16's own ANSI-0 convention (ANSI 0 = base00 =
  the default background regardless of polarity), and what both reference
  fixtures show (the built-in dark scheme's `black`/`white` sit in the
  `background`/`foreground` *family* respectively; the owner's light
  scheme sets `black` to their light background color and `white` to their
  dark foreground color — the opposite pairing a lightness pick would
  produce). "Light polarity inverts black/white" describes what happens
  to these two *values* once background/foreground themselves flip
  polarity, not a swap of which role gets which endpoint. `bright_black`
  is `text_subtle` — both reference fixtures agree on this exactly (the
  built-in's `bright_black` equals `TEXT_SUBTLE_DEFAULT`; the owner's own
  `bright_black` equals their `text_subtle`) — it's the terminal's
  de-emphasis gray (dimmed `ls` entries, shell autosuggestions), not a
  further push off `black`, which would risk landing back on the
  background it needs to stand out from. `bright_white` and the six
  colored `bright_*` hues *do* share one mechanism: an OKLCH lightness
  delta (`src/theme.rs`'s `BRIGHT_HUE_EMPHASIS_DELTA`, `0.1`) applied to
  the resolved *normal* color (`foreground` for `bright_white`, the
  matching hue for the rest), in the foreground's own direction (dark
  background: lighter; light background: darker), chroma and hue held
  fixed. As before, an explicit `[theme.ansi]` override (bright or
  normal, including `black`/`white` themselves) always wins regardless —
  the owner's own "bright = normal" config keeps working unchanged.
- **Semantic-color ↔ hue default mapping** — **Settled 2026-07-15,
  unsurprising:** `danger` ← `red`, `warning` ← `yellow`, `success` ←
  `green`, `info` ← `blue` (the same pairing the built-in constants
  already implied numerically — this design doc's own Evidence table
  measured them off the same hex values). Each candidate is
  contrast-snapped against the background exactly as the pre-existing
  `contrast_safe_default` already did, generalized to read the resolved
  (possibly user-overridden) hue instead of a fixed constant.
- **Accent-as-hex** — **Settled 2026-07-15 as "unchanged, not extended,"
  revised 2026-07-15 (later the same day, a follow-up dogfooding pass).**
  Slice B1 didn't add any new hover/active derivation keyed off accent:
  `surface_selected` (previously a `background`-toward-`accent` blend
  when unset) moved to the neutral ladder (background-toward-foreground,
  alongside `surface_panel`/`surface_raised`/`surface_chrome`/borders)
  instead — which, in dogfooding, made list selection read as flat gray
  on the seeded path, losing the accent-tinted character the
  zero-config formula (`LIST_ACTIVE_BLEND_RATIO`) always had. Reverted
  for `surface_selected` specifically, seeded path only:
  `src/theme.rs`'s `scheme_from` now blends `seed_background` toward the
  resolved `accent` again (`SURFACE_SELECTED_ACCENT_BLEND_RATIO`, a new
  constant distinct from `LIST_ACTIVE_BLEND_RATIO` so the zero-config
  default stays byte-identical) whenever the key itself is unset and the
  seed is configured. Every *other* neutral-ladder role
  (`surface_panel`/`surface_raised`/`surface_chrome`/`border`) is
  unaffected and still steps toward `foreground`, not `accent` — this is
  a `surface_selected`-only exception, not a reopening of the general
  "hue is preference, lightness geometry is theory" principle. The
  chosen ratio clears a minimum OKLab-lightness separation from
  `background` (a "clearly visible" check) while keeping `text_primary`
  painted on the result above the WCAG 4.5:1 floor against the owner's
  real (dark-blue-accent, light-background) fixture — both asserted in
  `src/theme.rs`'s tests, not assumed. `accent` itself, and
  gpui-component's `primary`/`ring`/`primary_foreground`/`caret`/
  `selection` projections that read it directly
  (`gpui_component_theme_config`), remain the only other consumers.

## Evidence (2026-07-15, measured on the owner's real scheme)

Background `#f6f6f6`; WCAG contrast ratios:

| color | ratio | reading |
|---|---|---|
| text_primary `#666666` | 5.31:1 | just above the 4.5 floor — deliberate softness |
| text_muted `#767676` | 4.20:1 | just **below** the floor — the faint-text problem |
| text_subtle `#a6a6a6` | 2.25:1 | decorative range |
| blue `#0048b3` / red `#b03b4c` / magenta `#643bb0` | 7.5 / 5.4 / 7.0 | readable as text |
| green `#00b312` / yellow `#87b03b` / cyan `#3bb09e` | 2.6 / 2.3 / 2.5 | not readable as text on this bg |

Neutral ladder in OKLab lightness: bg 0.97 → panel 0.83 → selected/border
0.73 → muted 0.57 → fg 0.51 (monotonic, unevenly stepped by feel).

## Related, independent fixes (not blocked on this design)

Found during the same investigation; each violates the existing "all
colors go through theme roles" invariant (`docs/agent-output-ui-design.md`)
or documented behavior, and can be fixed without waiting for the seed
work:

- **Fixed 2026-07-15.** `src/palette.rs`, `src/session_manager.rs`,
  `src/view_chooser.rs` hardcoded dark-scheme default literals
  (`0xe9ecf2` titles etc.) instead of theme roles — the direct cause of
  near-invisible palette text on light schemes. Now `theme::text_primary()`/
  `theme::danger()`/`theme::text_subtle()`/`theme::text_muted()`/
  `theme::success()` at each site (see those files' `render_item`).
- **Fixed 2026-07-15.** `src/agent/view.rs` send button hardcoded
  `white()` on the accent background instead of the accent-lightness-aware
  foreground pick. Now `theme::on_accent()`, a public accessor over the
  same `primary_foreground_for` pick `gpui_component_theme_config`
  already used internally.
- **Fixed 2026-07-15.** Docs claimed unknown `[theme]` keys and
  unparsable hex values warn on stderr; `src/theme.rs` silently ignored
  both. Now `scheme_from` calls `warn_invalid_theme_colors` once per
  resolution pass (startup + each `Reload Config`): an unrecognized
  `[theme]` key, or a recognized key whose value fails hex parsing (and
  a non-slot-name, non-hex `accent`), prints one `eprintln!` warning
  naming the key/value and still resolves that one role to its built-in
  default, exactly as before — only the missing stderr half of the
  documented behavior was added. The loader itself
  (`crates/horizon-config`'s flattened `colors: HashMap<String, String>`)
  stays untouched and still accepts arbitrary keys; the known-name list
  (`src/theme.rs`'s `KNOWN_THEME_COLOR_KEYS`) lives in `ui::theme`
  instead.
- **Fixed 2026-07-15.** `gpui_component_theme_config` left gpui-component's
  `caret`/`selection` fields to cascade from `primary` (== `scheme.accent`)
  rather than naming them explicitly — the cascade already produced the
  right color today, but left it dependent on gpui-component's own
  internal fallback chain rather than Horizon's own scheme. Now named
  explicitly: `caret` ← `scheme.accent`; `selection.background` ← the
  accent at a fixed low alpha (`SELECTION_ACCENT_ALPHA`, `#RRGGBBAA` hex,
  set to match gpui-component's own 0.3 alpha ceiling for `selection` so
  the look is unchanged).
- `docs/tasks/backlog.md` item 25: `Reload Config` does not repaint
  already-drawn terminal rows.
